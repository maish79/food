# About
My recipe app in Django is a great way to organize and share recipes online.The app typically includes features such as the ability to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) recipes
The recipe app is usually designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the app and find the recipes they are interested in. It can also include additional features such as creating profiles and leaving comments.

# UX
* The recipe app has a user friendly interface i.e it is easy to use and navigate through easily.
* I used a simple and visually appealing design.
* I personalizes the app by creating user profiles and ability to update pictures.
* There i also user feedback by leaving comments of the cuisine.
* There are also instructions on which type of ingredients and description of the cuisines.
